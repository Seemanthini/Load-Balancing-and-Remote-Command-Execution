# Load-Balancing-and-Remote-Command-Execution
Effective Implementation of Load Balancing and Remote Command Execution in C.


Using Concepts of Socket Programming in C implementation of Load Distribution/Balancing and Remote Command Execution is done.

For program execution the following is to be done:

* Three terminals are to be opened one for client.c, serv_load.c and serv_rce.c

* object file of client.c, serv_load.c and serv_rce.c is to be opened in each of these termianls respectively.

* Socket number is to be changed each time.

* The respective ip address of the machines have to be put in the programs if executed between 2 system.(This works only for 2 systems)

* If executed in a single system then loop back address or the ip address of the machine is enough.

* The Remote Command is executed in the machine with the least Load.
